# CDS-hazard-rate-risk-intensity-function
This code calculates the implied hazard rate/ risk intensity function from CDS prices. I have checked the solution from  this code with other paper.

It is just a meno which can vertify our function's correctness. In the meno, we input the data of Lamen Brothers and get the very close results. The little discrepency comes from the division of period.
